# Project 4 of Hacking With SwiftUI

## About the Project

BetterRest, the app that tells coffee drinkers when is the ideal time to go to sleep based on three features:
1. When you would like to wake up?
2. How many hours you would like to sleep?
3. How many cups of coffee you had?

This project covers more practice with SwiftUI fundamentals (like forms and alerts) and learn some new UI controls like DatePicker and Stepper. We learned that dates are not easy to use in SwiftUI, but tools like DateComponents can make it easier. We also got to mess around in CreateML! I've learned machine learning in theory at the University of Toronto, its awesome to be able to apply it in an actual project.

### Built With

Xcode, SwiftUI, CoreML

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install XCode

### Getting the files onto your computer

Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or GitHub Desktop. 

For example, this is how using git could potentially look like: 
```
https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
```

You should replace `your_username` and `project_name` respectively.

### Running the project

1. Get started by opening up the project in XCode by clicking on the file ending with `.xcodeproj`.
2. Once the project is open in Xcode, you can select a device (ex. iPhone 15) and run it on a simulator by pressing Cmd + R or clicking on the play button at the top-left corner of the screen.

This project is from a tutorial series provided by Hacking With Swift. The tutorial series is called 100 Days of SwiftUI. Part 3 introduces challenges where I made additions with my own code.
